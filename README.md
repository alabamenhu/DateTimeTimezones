# DateTime::Timezones

An extremely early and experimental module to extend the built in `DateTime` with timezone support.
To use, simply include it at any point in your code:

```raku 
use DateTime::Timezones;
```

This extends `DateTime` to include the following three new attributes whose names *are subject to change*.

  * **`.olson-id`** *(Str)*  
  The unique identifier for the timezone. 
  These are maintained by the IANA and based around city names, in the format of *Region/City*, and occasionally *Region/Subregion/City*. 
  They do not tend to align with popular usage.  In the United States, for instance, what is commonly called Eastern Time is listed as America/New_York).
  * **`.tz-abbr`** *(Str)*  
  An (mostly) unique abbreviation for the timezone. 
  It normally is more representative of popular usage (so *EST* for Eastern Standard Time in America/New_York).
  * **`.is-dst`** *(Bool)*  
  This value is `True` if the timezone is in what is commonly referred to as either Daylight Saving Time (hence the attribute name) or Summer Time where the timezone is shifted by (normally) one hour.
  The value is `False` during Standard time which in many timezones is the only possible value.


For the most part, once you enable it, you won't need to do anything different at all, as it is designed to be as discreet as possible.
There are, nonetheless, a few things to note:

 * The default time zone is either **Etc/GMT** *or*, if you have `Intl::UserTimezone`, the one indicated by `user-timezone`.
 * The attribute `timezone` has been modified slightly. 
 You may pass either an integer *or* an Olson ID.
 If you pass an integer, it will be taken into account, but the resultant time will be zoned to GMT.
 When accessing `timezone`, you will get the offset with the Olson ID mixed in, so it should Just Workâ„¢. 
 If you absolutely must have a strict `Int` value, use `.offset`, and for a strict `Str` value, use `.olson-id`
 * **(NYI)** The formatter has been changed to indicate the timezone.
 This makes it incompatible with RFC 3339.
 The `use` option 'rfc3339' will restore the original formatter.
 * Because of how precompilation works, it may be possible for some `DateTime` objects to have been created without having the `TimezoneAware` role mixed in. 
 Guards will *eventually* be added, but in the meantime, it's possible for some `DateTime` objects to not support timezones.
 * I have absolutely no idea (read: have not tested) how `.later()` and `.earlier()` function.
 You may get unexpected results if you use them and cross a timezone transition.
 
### Leapseconds

Leapseconds are annoying for timekeeping.
POSIX explicitly ignores them.
Future ones are unpredictable because weird physics.
I do not have the expertise to ensure that leapseconds are handled correctly, but welcome any code review and/or pull requests to remedy this.

## How does it work?

While the module initially planned on `augment`ing `DateTime`, it turns out that has significant problems for things like precompilation (you can't) and requires enabling `MONKEY-TYPING` which just feels dirty.

Instead, `DateTime.new` is wrapped with a new method that returns the same (or functionally the same) `DateTime` you would have expected and mixes in the parameterized `TimezoneAware` role. 
It has a few tricks to make sure it doesn't apply the role multiple times.

The data files come from the [IANA](https://www.iana.org/time-zones), although at the moment we don't do our own compiling of them to binary form.
Soon an easy updater script will be written for future maintainers.
